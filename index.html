    <p>
      For this interface, I wanted to allow viewers to explore the space around them using their own bodies through 
      ml5.js BodySegmentation models. I applied live video processing to split the viewer's body into parts and
      represent those parts in various shapes, colors, sizes, and distances from the body.

    <p>Began testing how ml5.js breaks down body parts.</p>
    <br/>

    <img src="process2.png" width="800">
    <p>Played around with manipulating shapes to cover different body parts, including but not limited to pixelated effects and shapes
    offset from the body part it's referencing. </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Mind Mapping</h2>
    <img src="interface-braindump.jpg" width="800">
    <p> I then mind mapped the ideas I explored earlier in the braindump to solidify an idea of what I wanted to express, and landed on the following: </p>
    <p><i>Everything is perception. People perceive different parts of their body in different ways, trying to break people down into just shapes and colors 
      that don't perfectly fit into their physical form</i></p>

    <br/>

    <h2>Continued Exploration</h2>
    <p>I added more body parts into the code, and then added a semi-transparent layer of shapes over to solidify further the idea that everything is shapes and colors, 
      and we are all shapes and colors existing in planes</p>
    <br/>
