    <h1>GIXD 503A interactive experience</h1>
    <p>
      For this interface, I wanted to allow the user to explore the space around them using their own body through 
      ml5.js BodySegmentation models. I applied live video processing to split the user's body into parts and
      represent those parts in various shapes, colors, sizes, and distances from the body.
